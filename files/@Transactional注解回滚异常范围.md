### @Transactional注解回滚异常范围
@Transactional注解中默认发生RuntimeException和Error时才会回滚，至于原因org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.DefaultTransactionAttribute中有给出解释：RuntimeException和Error均被认为预料之外的结果，而受检查异常被认为是业务异常，在有事务的方法中是一个常规可预见的结果，任然允许常规资源操作的完成，所以@Transactional默认情况情况下不会因为受检查的异常的产生去回滚数据，原文为
>The default behavior is as with EJB: rollback on unchecked exception ({@link RuntimeException}), assuming an unexpected outcome outside of any business rules. Additionally, we also attempt to rollback on {@link Error} which is clearly an unexpected outcome as well. By contrast, a checked exception is considered a business exception and therefore a regular expected outcome of the transactional business method, i.e. a kind of alternative return value which still allows for regular completion of resource operations. This is largely consistent with TransactionTemplate's default behavior, except that TransactionTemplate also rolls back on undeclared checked exceptions (a corner case). For declarative transactions, we expect checked exceptions to be intentionally declared as business exceptions, leading to a commit by default.
